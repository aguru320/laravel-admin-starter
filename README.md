## Note

Please keep in mind this is for my personal workflow and might not fit your need.
This is my starter project for most small crud admin portals.
I try to keep it clean, flexibly and friendly to use. This is not a complete project or best practises, just trying to help the community :).
Please let me know about any issues or if you have any suggestions.
